Smart Waste Disposal Monitoring System,"Waste management is one of the primary problem that the world faces irrespective of the case of developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. Sometime the garbage collector truck not sufficient for collecting all the garbage. These in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor & ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. Another issue is in the waste management is having more trucks and human resources than needed. To avoid all such hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health this work is mounted on a smart garbage system.  We are living in an age where tasks and systems are fusing together with the power of IOT to have a more efficient system of working and to execute jobs quickly! With all the power at our finger tips this is what we have come up with.       The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present technologies. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for a proper garbage management. What our system does is it gives a real time indicator of the garbage level in a trashcan at any given time using weight and volume (solar) sensors. Using that data and as the bins are containing GSM module we can give an alert signal to the municipal web server then optimize waste collection efficient routes, sufficient number of trucks and labors. It allows trash collectors to plan their daily/weekly pick up schedule.",E14,Cyber-Physical Systems Projects,https://projects.ce.pdn.ac.lk/3yp/e14/Smart-Waste-Disposal-Monitoring-System/,https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e14-3yp-Smart-Waste-Disposal-Monitoring-System,https://cepdnaclk.github.io/e14-3yp-Smart-Waste-Disposal-Monitoring-System,https://cepdnaclk.github.io/e14-3yp-Smart-Waste-Disposal-Monitoring-System/data/index.json,http://api.ce.pdn.ac.lk/projects/v1/3yp/E14/Smart-Waste-Disposal-Monitoring-System/

Optimizing chloroplast genome assembly and annotation with skim sequencing data,"Chloroplast genes and genomes are the most important genomic data for plant phylogeny and species identification. Skim sequencing is obtaining low coverage genome sequencing data that includes, nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondria genome sequences. Since the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, it is cheap to get the low coverage data of whole genome (usually about 20-30GB data), which is enough to assemble a complete chloroplast genome.

nearIR spectroscopy," Near-Infrared spectroscopy is used for better vein visualization to make the venipuncture process more efficient. It is usually a painful and time-consuming process and its difficulty increases with the dark skin tones, obesity of patients, and several other health and physical conditions.  Although near-IR spectroscopy is identified as a good solution, its usage is limited to availability, high cost, and doubts about accuracy. The cost of each of these products is very high and not affordable especially in countries like ours. We have implemented a mechanism for better accuracy and lower risk, using an illumination system that favors Asian skin types, while reducing the cost of the device so that it is more affordable especially for common clinical use in countries like ours.",E15,Undergraduate Research Projects,https://projects.ce.pdn.ac.lk/4yp/e15/nearIR-spectroscopy/,https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e15-4yp-nearIR-spectroscopy,https://cepdnaclk.github.io/e15-4yp-nearIR-spectroscopy,https://cepdnaclk.github.io/e15-4yp-nearIR-spectroscopy/data/index.json,http://api.ce.pdn.ac.lk/projects/v1/4yp/E15/nearIR-spectroscopy/

sports action recognition,"This includes a novel method to measure the quality of the actions performed in Olympic weightlifting using human action recognition in videos. Human action recognition is a well-studied problem in computer vision and on the other hand action quality assessment is researched and experimented comparatively low. This is due to the lack of datasets that can be used to assess the quality of actions. In this research, we introduce a method to assess player techniques in weightlifting by using skeleton-based human action recognition. Furthermore, we introduce a new video dataset for action recognition in weightlifting which is annotated to frame level. We intended to develop a viable automated scoring system through action recognition that would be beneficial in the sports industry.

Flood Forecasting System,"Floods are the most destructive form of natural hazards in both local and global context. This is true in terms of both loss of life and property damage. Early flood forecasting can be used to identify potential areas of flooding in order to develop mitigatory planning and evacuation programs to remove people from such areas during flooding and also to implement suitable preventive measures to avoid damage to properties. In this project, our main objective is to build a flood forecasting system for Mi Oya river basin(Sri Lanka). Mi Oya Basin is heavily affected by seasonal flooding and droughts. As per the available data, floods in the Mi Oya basin are unleashed due to river overflow and reservoir spilling. Out of the several reservoirs located in the basin, Tabbowa and Inginimitiya are crucial in worsening the flood impacts as these two reservoirs are frequently spilling under adverse weather conditions. As such, the prevalence of a real-time flood forecasting model with the incorporation of the reservoir operations for the entire basin is essential to alleviate the flood induced impacts while preserving the optimum volume of water in the major reservoirs in the basin.",E17,Software Engineering Projects (CO328),https://projects.ce.pdn.ac.lk/co328/e17/Flood-Forecasting-System/,https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e17-co328-Flood-Forecasting-System,https://cepdnaclk.github.io/e17-co328-Flood-Forecasting-System,https://cepdnaclk.github.io/e17-co328-Flood-Forecasting-System/data/index.json,http://api.ce.pdn.ac.lk/projects/v1/co328/E17/Flood-Forecasting-System/
